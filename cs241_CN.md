# Intro to Computer Networks

A computer network inter-connects a group of computing devices and allows processes running on different devices to communicate by sending messages which are forwarded by intermeiate nodes in the network.

## Computer Network Components

**General structure:**

### **End hosts:**

The edges of the network, consisting of personal devices and servers that run processes requiring communication over the network, e.g. web browsers, online games, email servers, etc.

These hosts **must** be able to: break down messages into '*packets*', add '*packet headers*' to them containing necessary information to travel through the network and send the packets over a communication link.

End hosts **could** (not required) also ensure reliable and orderly delivery of the packets depending on the transfer protocol used, and control the rate of transmission of packets.

### **Network Links:**

**Packet Switches:** intermediate devices that transfer data packets between nodes on the network, e.g. switches and routers.

**Communication Links:** Physical links between network devices, e.g. ethernet, fiber, wireless links, etc.

### **Access points:**

Nodes that directly connect the end hosts to the rest of the network, e.g. home routers, institutional routers, mobile data towers, etc. They are regulated and provided by '*Internet Service Providers*' (ISPs) which are hierarchical from regional (BT, Sky, etc) to global ISPs that interconnect regional ISPs.

## **Packet Transmission**

**Routing:**

Run routing algorithms to construct routing tables - a mapping of destination IP addresses to the next destination to send packets. This is done by packet switches and changes based on network usage so not all packets sent to the same destination take the same route.

**Forwarding:**

Once a packet arrives it is forwarded to the appropriate output according to the routing table.

**store-and-forward:** The entire packet must arrive at a node before it can be transmitted to the next node. Therefore the end-to-end delay of a node from beginning of reception to end of forwarding is 2L/R where L is the amount of bits in the packet and R is the link speed in bps. A large L means that the delay is long, so unsuitable for real-time applications like remote control of machine.

### **Delays**

**Queueing delay & loss:** If the arrival rate to a node is greater than the output transmission rate then packets enter a buffer to be sent in the node. Packets are dropped (lost) if the memory buffer fills up, and this is quite common.

**Delay Types:**

- **transmission delay: d<sub>trans</sub>**
  - L: packet length (bits)
  - R: link bandwidth (bps)
  - D<sub>trans</sub> = L/R
- **queueing delay: d<sub>queue</sub>**
  - time waiting in buffer to be sent
  - dependant on congestion level of node
- **nodal processing: d<sub>proc</sub>**
  - check for bit errors
  - determining the correct output link
  - typically very small, < 1ms
- **propagation delay: d<sub>prop</sub>**
  - d: length of physical link
  - s: propagation speed in link (typically 2x10<sup>8</sup> ms<sup>-1</sup>)
  - d<sub>prop</sub> = d/s
- **total delay: d<sub>nodal</sub>**
  - sum of above delays

### **Throughput**

The rate at which bits are transferred between a specific communicating pair of nodes.

*Instantaneous:* rate at a given point in time (average over a very small period).

*average:* rate over a longer period or entire duration of communication.

'*bottleneck link*': The link on an end-to-end path with the smallest throughput, limiting the total throughput to that link's speed (average will be this throughput too).

### Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching

Packet Switching:

- Resources can be shared between flows/communicating pairs
- Packets can be delayed or lost
- Multiple flows can use the same link at once, good use of resources

Circuit Switching:

- Resources can only be used by one flow/communicating pair for the duration of communication: this is called a circuit
- Guaranteed rate of transmission and no delay/losses during communication
- Doesn't allow multiple flows to use the same resource at the same time, so poor use of resources with 'bursty' traffic

## **Communication Protocols**

Protocols define rules of communication - the format and order of messages sent/received, as well as actions taken on message transmission/receipt.

These can be implemented in software that runs on nodes/routers, or in hardware using logic. Most protocols are specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), though other bodies like the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers (IEEE) specify some standard like Ethernet and WiFi.

### Layering

Network protocols and devices need to perform many complex functions. These functions are divided into layers where layer N provides services to N+1 and uses services from N-1. Layering makes it easier to add services or change implementations in a layer without affecting the rest of the layers.

The internet protocol (IP) stack has 5 layers that contain all possible functions. Not all layers have to be present in a network device, e.g. packet switches do not use the application layer.

![IP layer stack](IP_layers.png)

'*IP address*': unique software ID of an end host (not all nodes have an IP address).

'*MAC address*': Media Access Control address, the unique physical ID of a node in the network (all nodes in a network have a MAC address)

Each layer adds their own header to the packet with data specific to that layers protocols. As the packet is processed at nodes, the layers are stripped away and added with updated data to be sent to the next node, e.g. the hardware address of the next node.

# Application Layer

## Network Applications

A process running on a host machine that uses the network to send messages to a process on a different host machine is a network application. E.g. email, peer-to-peer file sharing, web servers, etc. *Client processes* request data, and *server processes* provide data.

If not using standard protocols, a developer generally has to create both the client and server sides of the application. Standard protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc) allow developers to only create one side, and the protocol dictates how it would communicate with the other side.

## Sockets

'*Sockets*' allow application layer user network processes access to the kernel-controlled network layers. Creating, reading from and writing to sockets is done using system calls.

## Ports

Ports are 16 bit numbers from 0-65535. These are used to identify which process running on a machine to deliver packets to once at the end host. Port numbers 0-1023 are reserved for standard network applications, e.g. 80 for HTTP, 25 for SMTP, etc. User application processes can use any other port above 1023.

# Transport Layer

All transport layer protocols offer some basic services:

- packetisation, addressing, sequencing, error correcting bits

There are two main transport layer protocols used in the internet: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
