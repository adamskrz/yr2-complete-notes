# Intro to Computer Networks

A computer network inter-connects a group of computing devices and allows processes running on different devices to communicate by sending messages which are forwarded by intermeiate nodes in the network.

## Computer Network Components

**End hosts:** The edges of the network, consisting of personal devices and servers that run processes requiring communication over the network, e.g. web browsers, online games, email servers, etc.

**Packet Switches:** intermediate devices that transfer data packets between nodes on the network, e.g. switches and routers.

**Communication Links:** Physical links between network devices, e.g. ethernet, fiber, wireless links, etc.

**Access points:** Nodes that directly connect the end hosts to the rest of the network, e.g. home routers, mobile data towers, etc. They are regulated and provided by '*Internet Service Providers*' (ISPs) which are hierarchical from regional (BT, Sky, etc) to global ISPs that interconnect regional ISPs.
